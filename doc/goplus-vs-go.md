Go+ vs. Go
======

What's the difference between Go+ and Go?

The goal of Go is to provide a way to easily build simple, reliable, and efficient software. It wants to be a better C.

The goal of Go+ is to achieve a natural fusion of engineering and low-code. It wants to be a better Python.

The essence of low-code is non-professionals oriented. Today's mainstream programming language designers still take non-professionals as a niche group. But Go+ take this group as vital, and they are a vital breakthrough in today's programming language revolution.

The Python language appeared very early (1991), but its design idea is very far-sighted, and it is a rare non-professionals oriented programming language so far. There are quite a few languages that look relatively concise, such as Ruby and CoffeeScript, but they have many language magics so that people feel they are flexible and powerful, but not easy to master. They cannot be regarded as non-professionals oriented.

Python is very popular today, but it's hard to call it an engineering language. Most people just take it as a tool for rapid prototyping.

Is it possible to minimize the complexity of engineering and present it in a low-code form? Go+ hopes to explore a new path at this point.
